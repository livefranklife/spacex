## Orbital Launch · Educational React Demo

This repository contains an educational, non-commercial React project inspired by the design and content of the official [SpaceX website](https://www.spacex.com/) and [SpaceX Store](https://shop.spacex.com/). It is **not** affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by SpaceX.

The app is built with **React + TypeScript** and focuses on:

- **Launches** – a launches view, inspired by [`spacex.com/launches`](https://www.spacex.com/launches), that lists upcoming and past missions.
- **Rockets** – a fleet overview with high-level information about Starship, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy.
- **UI & Motion** – modern layout, motion, and hover states suitable for learning advanced front‑end techniques.

All vehicle and mission details here are simplified and intended purely for **learning and experimentation with React**, not for real operational or business use.
